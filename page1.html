        <p>On a moonless spring night, shooting stars were everywhere, as Organplaying Wood was bustling with life. Specially the harbour's famous bar, Zanzibar. As the clock tower stuck midnight, the captain cat dressed in a skylark blue coat with a bootlace bow. He walked into the bar and asked the parrot bartender for two shots of coconut rum.
            Next to him sat a drunkard donkeyman with seaweed on his hooves, drinking rum and smoking weed. Yet the captain recognized him despite the donkey's terrible looks. He was the famous tradesman Rover.</p>
