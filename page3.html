    <h1>The ship in bottle bombazine.</h1>
    <div id="container">
        <p>-The two men went upstairs into a room. In the room, there was a Chinese dog tied up on the bed. The drunk donkey didn't lie. She was truly a bombazine. Her ebony fur as a silky dress glowed under the golden light. Seeing her butterfly choker around her neck and the crow black shawls that covered her shoulders, the captain was speechless. He was bearly choking out the words.
            - "Oh-oh-oh m-my dear d-dead looord!!! She is a gooddess!!!"
            The captain froze in his stand, his chin dropped and Rover smirked next to the captain.
            - "I told you, she has some hot water bottle body, but she's going to be expensive, mate."
            Reminded him Rover and he took a sip from his bottle.</p>
