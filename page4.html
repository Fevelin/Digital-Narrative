        <p>The price was not a matter for Alfred, he was determined to take the female dog. As he looked at her, he felt possessed by the female. The dog gave a tidy wife radiance. He knew this woman would be her precious trophy. They shook hands in agreement as they decided on the price.
            When Alfred tried to claim his acquest, the dog tore apart her handcuffs and chains. She bent the frisky cat through his chest. She sits on top of him slowly unbuttoning the cat's coat. When she unbuttoned the last button on his coat, she stroked his face with lustful eyes. The male cat was stunned. He never had a female who was at least two heads bigger than his size. She pulled out from the male cat's pants the blade and cut the male's throat. Rover's eyes were wide in astonishment. He tried to leave before the dog cut his neck but it was too late. She was way faster than the drunken donkey. One hit on his head and the donkey fell as a potato bag. Miss Price took the bag of gold and the captain's coat.  She left a bomb in the donkey's mouth and walked out of the bar.</p>
